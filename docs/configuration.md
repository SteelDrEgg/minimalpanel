# Configuration model

`config.toml` is the persistent representation of configuration. The effective
configuration is the validated state currently held by `internal/conf`.
Runtime code reads configuration through `conf` queries and does not retain a
second long-lived configuration tree.

Relative paths are resolved against the process working directory.

## Reload and update

`Reload` reads the complete `config.toml`, rejects unknown or incorrectly cased
fields, validates the candidate, and publishes it in memory only when the whole
file is valid. An empty file is valid and selects the hard-coded defaults.

`Update` accepts one or more ordered path operations. At the start of the
transaction it reads and validates the latest `config.toml`, uses that
configuration as its base, and applies the operations to both a shallow
copy-on-write candidate and a layout-preserving TOML document. It verifies that
both results are equivalent, replaces `config.toml` with mode `0600`, and then
publishes the candidate in memory. A validation or persistence failure leaves
the effective in-memory configuration unchanged. All reloads and updates are
serialized by `conf`.

Consequently, a successful `Update` also makes other valid edits already
present on disk effective, even if `Reload` was not called first. An invalid
disk document causes `Update` to fail without changing the current
configuration.

Update paths use case-sensitive JSON Pointer syntax. Fixed field names are
declared by `conf` constants; dynamic map keys are escaped as JSON Pointer
segments. The current rules are:

- `Set` rejects a nil value.
- `Remove` of a missing path succeeds without changing configuration.
- Missing map nodes are created by `Set`.
- Arrays are replaced as a whole.
- Operations in one `Update` are applied in the supplied order.

Only the bytes expressing an updated path are rewritten. Comments, whitespace,
line endings, and ordering outside the updated value are retained. Replacing or
removing a complete table also removes comments attached to that table and its
contents.

Cross-process coordination with a future standalone configuration CLI is
intentionally left as a TODO. Without cooperative locking, an external write
that races between Update's read and atomic replacement remains last-writer
wins.

## HTTP API capabilities

The optional `[API]` table controls which management domains are exposed over
HTTP. Missing fields are `false`.

```toml
[API]
User = true
Group = true
Pages = true
Access = true
Service = true
Log = true
Network = true
```

Each capability is checked against the current conf state on every request, so
Reload takes effect without rebuilding the HTTP mux. Disabled capability routes
return not found. Session endpoints and kernel reload are not capability-gated.
Every non-session management endpoint requires authentication.

`Route.Allow` applies an optional group policy on top of endpoint
authentication. Keys may use the backward-compatible path-only form, which
matches every HTTP method, or a method-qualified form:

```toml
[Route.Allow]
"/api/" = ["users"]
"GET:/api/user" = ["auditors"]
"PATCH:/api/user/" = ["administrators"]
```

Methods must be uppercase. `GET` also covers `HEAD`. Matching first selects the
longest path; at the same path, a method-qualified rule wins over a path-only
rule. An absent matching rule and a matching rule with an empty group list both
allow access. Management handlers still enforce their baseline authentication.

## Defaults and services

Defaults are hard-coded and are consulted when the current configuration does
not set a field. Defaults are documented behavior and are not written to
`config.toml`.

To `conf`, `Services.default` is an ordinary service entry. The Service Manager
interprets it as the base for a named service. Defining Params on it is allowed
but discouraged.

For service inheritance:

- An unset `Allow` inherits the default service value. An explicitly empty
  `Allow = []` overrides it and leaves the service open.
- Empty or whitespace-only `RunAsUser` and `Checksum` do not override inherited
  values.
- Params are merged by key and the named service wins.

## When changes take effect

| Configuration | Effective boundary |
| --- | --- |
| `Users`, `Groups`, `Route`, `Pages` | The next authentication or HTTP request |
| `Services.<name>.Allow` | The next request to that service, including already running services |
| `ServiceDir` | The next service scan; list, start, and restart scan on demand |
| `ServiceTempDir` | The next service load; a running service keeps its current extraction directory |
| Service `Restart`, `RunAsUser`, `Checksum` | The next start or explicit restart |
| Service `Params` | The next Params query and the next start; Params already supplied during registration are not pushed into a running service |
| `Listen`, `TLS`, `Log` | Kernel startup; changing them requires restarting the kernel |

The management API derives `requires_restart` by comparing the current
effective value with the value actually used by the running component.
Listen, TLS, and Log are compared with the kernel's startup values. For
ServiceTempDir, each running service records the directory used when it was
loaded; the flag remains true until no running service uses a different
directory.

Existing authentication sessions currently remain valid until logout or
expiry after user configuration changes. The desired invalidation behavior is
intentionally left as a TODO.
